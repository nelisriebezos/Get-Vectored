Physical Description
Humans are diverse in appearance, with skin tones ranging from pale to bronzed, reflecting their varied climates. Their hair comes in shades of black, brown, red, and blonde, and their eyes span from common browns and blues to striking greens and grays. Physically, humans vary greatly. Some are stocky and muscular, while others are lean and agile, depending on their region. Facial features are equally varied, from sharp and angular to softer, rounder profiles. This diversity makes humans highly adaptable, reflecting their widespread presence across the continent.

Lore
Humans have been a presence on the continent of Oriath for countless generations. While the elves and dwarves built sprawling kingdoms rich in culture and arcane mastery, humans lived in scattered tribes, more attuned to the land than to the mysteries of magic. Their shorter lifespans meant they often lagged behind the elves and dwarves yet their intelligence and adaptability were never to be underestimated. Unlike the more rooted elves and dwarves, humans possessed a drive to explore, settle, and conquer new lands.
Before long, humans could be found in every corner of the continent. They adapted to the harshest climates, thrived in unforgiving landscapes, and built settlements where none had thought to venture. Whether it was magic and sorcery, the arts and sciences, or trade and architecture, humans proved themselves capable of mastering any field they dedicated themselves to. Their relentless curiosity and hunger for knowledge became both their greatest strength and their sometimes their undoing.
It was this unquenchable thirst for power that eventually led humans into the dark embrace of Tartarus, the hellish realm where demons dwell. Many humans struck bargains with the infernal powers, which granted them the dark magic and power they craved. Kingdoms rose from the ashes of these pacts, their rulers emboldened by demonic forces. However, the same power that built these kingdoms also sowed discord, as rival human factions, each fortified by infernal and arcane magic, waged war for dominance over the land.
These constant wars and power struggles eventually culminated in the rise of the Black Empire. A vast and powerful nation that thrived on the reckless abuse of magic. Fueled by infernal power, the empire spread its influence across the continent, consuming smaller kingdoms in its wake. However no one rules forever, and the Black Empire’s reign would eventually come to an end. Its collapse plunged the human race into chaos, scattering its people into fractured kingdoms once more.
In the aftermath, human society splintered into a colorful mosaic of different cultures and governments. Some regions, scarred by the horrors of the Black Empire, embraced democratic ideals, seeking stability in shared power. Others, still hungry for dominion, reformed into new kingdoms, while some communities fell back into tribal structures, finding solace in the old ways. This diversity has become a defining feature of the human race, fueling their adaptability, resilience, and growth across the continent.
